# The Retro Game: Snake 🐍

This repository contains the code for the snake game made with python. I would want to add more stuff in it,
but overtime it became really repetitive and I just got bored. And I'm too lazy to package it properly using
pyinstaller so bare with me.

## Build

```
git clone https://github.com/minmin2104/snake
cd snake
python -m venv .venv
```

Before you install the requirements, activate the venv.

On Windows:
```
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On Unix:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
